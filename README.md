Project setup: Initialize a new React project using create-react-app using npm.,
I used to create react-app commands : 
1.npm install create-react-app 
2. create-react-app user management (name of the project)
3 install all dependencies using npm 



My Component structure :
1. created a Components folder inside that folder UserForm and UserList as a child component
2. UserForm: Created a Form using this component
3. UserList: Create a list of users using this component and render the Users list.
4. Finally combine these components into the parent file App.js
